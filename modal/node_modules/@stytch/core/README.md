## Overview

This package provides core implementations for the Javascript SDKs - `@stytch/vanilla-js`, `@stytch/react-native`.
Application code should never refer to this package directly.

### Internals

This package contains shared types, errors, and utilities for the Stytch Javascript SDKs.

This package has two entrypoints -

```javascript
// All publicly consumed types - requests, responses, UI config, etc
export * from '@stytch/core/public'

// All internal utilities
import { logger, InternalErrorType, ... } from '@stytch/core'
```
